# HospitalManagmenT_System
This is a simple yet functional Hospital Management System built using core Java. It runs in the console and allows users to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and billing through a menu-driven interface. Designed with object-oriented principles, this project is ideal for learning Java basics, file handling, and building structured applications without a GUI. Perfect for beginners or as a foundation for future upgrades like database or GUI support
